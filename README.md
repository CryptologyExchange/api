# INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Cryptology trader and developer documentation. These documents outline exchange functionality, market details, and APIs.

APIs are separated into two categories: trading and feed. Access to APIs requires authentication and provides access for placing orders, provides market data and other account information.

By accessing the Cryptology Data API, you agree to the [Terms & Conditions](https://cryptology.com/legal/terms/)

To access the Trading API server, add an access/secret key pair on [Account](https://cryptology.com/app/account) / [API](https://cryptology.com/app/account/api) section of Cryptology website.
You can generate one or more key pairs.

# GENERAL INFORMATION

## Matching Orders

Cryptology market operates a first come-first serve order matching. Orders are executed as received by the matching engine, from the older to newer received orders.

## Self-Trade Prevention

To discourage wash trading, Cryptology exchange cancels smaller order and
decreases larger order size by the smaller order size when two orders
from the same client cross. Yet Cryptology charges taker fee for the smaller order.
 If the two orders are the same size, both will be canceled, yet 
 Cryptology will charge taker fee for one order.

## Rate Limit

Currently Cryptology has a rate limit of 10 requests per second for WebSocket
API and 1 request per second for HTTPS API. If you reach this limit you will receive
a message with `THROTTLING` response type and
`overflow_level` param which must be used for waiting for `overflow_level`
milliseconds.

## Unfair Price Prevention

We prevent order placement with a price different from the market price by more than 10%.
For example, if current best ask is 1000, you can't make Buy order with a price
greater than 1100. And if the current best bid is 1000, you can't make Sell order
with a price lower than 900.

## Decimal Precision

Each amounts and a prices on Cryptology have 8 decimal places.


## Order Lifecycle

Valid orders sent to the matching engine are confirmed immediately and are in the received state. If an order executes against another order immediately, the order is considered done. An order can execute in part or whole. Any part of an order not filled immediately, will be considered open. Orders will stay in the open state until canceled or subsequently filled by new orders. Orders that are no longer eligible for matching (filled or canceled) are in the done state.

Currently WS API supports the following limit orders types: fill or kill (**FOK**) orders,
immediate or cancel (**IOK**) orders, good 'til canceled (**GTC**) orders, and good 'til day (**GTD**) orders.

A fill or kill (**FOK**) is a type of time-in-force designation used in securities trading that instructs an exchange
to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. The order must be filled in its entirety
or canceled (killed).

An immediate or cancel order (**IOC**) is an order to buy or sell a security that must be immediately filled.
Any unfilled portion of the order is canceled.

A good â€™til canceled (**GTC**) describes an order a trader may place to buy or sell a security that remains
active until either the order is filled or the trader cancels it.

A good 'til day order is an order which will be canceled at the time preset by a trader if it is not executed or cancelled until this time.  A GTD order contains the Time To Live (**TTL**) instruction.
Time To Live is a special instruction which shows the time in which an order will be automatically canceled. 


## Fees

## Data Centers

Cryptology data centers are in the Amazon EU region.

## Sandbox

A public sandbox is available for testing API connectivity and web trading. The sandbox provides all of the functionality of the production exchange but allows you to add fake funds for testing.

Login sessions and API keys are separate from production. We will issue some testing keys for you, to use them in the sandbox web interface and the sandbox environment.

To add funds, use the web interface deposit and withdraw buttons as you would on the production web interface.

**Sandbox URLs:**
When testing your API connectivity, make sure to use the following URLs.

# Trading protocol

Cryptology API operates over the WebSocket protocol with PING
heartbeat being sent every 4 seconds (for details about WebSocket protocol,
read [RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)).



## Authentication

After connecting to WebSocket Trading Server, send a message for authentication on the server.
With client-side authentication message, send `last_seen_message_id`.
After successful authentication, the server sends an authentication message
to WebSocket connection and all messages addressed to you with `message_id`
started from `last_seen_message_id`, but not older than 1 day.

With server-side authentication message, you receive `last_seen_sequence`.
Start sending messages to the server with `sequence_id` more than
`last_seen_sequence` in series. For example, if you receive `last_seen_sequence`
equal to 654,`sequence_id` of next client message which will be sent to the server
is 655. Otherwise, the connection will be closed with "Invalid Sequence" error.
`sequence_id` in all subsequent client messages must be serial.
For example 656, 657, 658 etc.

### Client sends a message in the following format:

> Example of client message:

```json
 {
    "access_key": "access key",
    "secret_key": "secret key",
    "last_seen_message_id": -1,
    "version": 6,
    "get_balances": true,
    "get_order_books": false
 }

```

| Name       | Description          |
| :-------------: |:-------------|
| `access_key`  | is a client access key |
| `secret_key`  | is a client secret key |
| `last_seen_message_id` | is the last message id which client got from a server in previous sessions or -1|
| `protocol_version` | is a version of protocol|
| `get_balances`| optional flags which ask the server to send user balances and (default: false)|
| `get_order_books`|optional flags which ask the server to send user order books (default: false)|


### Server responds in the following format:

> Example of server response:

```json

## Server Messages

## Order Lifecycle

After a place order message is received by Cryptology the following messages will
be sent over web socket connection. All order-related messages are user specific
(i.e. you can't receive any of these messages for regular or other user orders).
The `time` parameter is a list of two integers. The first one is a UNIX timestamp in
the UTC time zone. The second is a number of microseconds.

-   `BuyOrderPlaced`, `SellOrderPlaced`
    :   order was received by cryptology. `closed_inline` indicates an
        order that was fully executed immediately, itâ€™s safe not to
        expect (and, therefore ignore) other messages for this order.
        End of order lifecycle. `initial_amount` equals to the full
        order size while `amount` is the part of the order left after
        instant order execution and placed to the order book.


> BuyOrderPlaced / SellOrderPlaced


   ```json
    {
        "@type": "BuyOrderPlaced",
        "amount": "1",
        "initial_amount": "3",
        "closed_inline": false,

        "client_order_id": 123
    }
   ```

-   `PlacingOrderCancelled`
    :   placing order was canceled (no trading volume, price out of market)

> PlacingOrderCancelled


   ```json
    {
        "@type": "PlacingOrderCancelled",
        "order_id": 1,
        "time": [
            946684800,
            0
        ],
        "trade_pair": "BTC_USD",
        "reason": "price_out_of_market",
        "client_order_id": 123
    }
   ```

-   `BuyOrderAmountChanged`, `SellOrderAmountChanged`
    :   order was partially executed, sets a new amount

> BuyOrderAmountChanged / SellOrderAmountChanged

   ```json
    {
        "@type": "BuyOrderAmountChanged",
        "amount": "1",
        "order_id": 1,

        ],
        "trade_pair": "BTC_USD",
        "client_order_id": 123
    }
   ```

-   `BuyOrderCancelled`, `SellOrderCancelled`
    :   order was canceled (manual, TTL, IOC, FOK, tbd), end of order
        lifecycle

> BuyOrderCancelled / SellOrderCancelled    


   ```json
    {
        "@type": "BuyOrderCancelled",
        "order_id": 1,
        "time": [
            946684800,
            0
        ],
        "trade_pair": "BTC_USD",
        "client_order_id": 123
    }
   ```


-   `BuyOrderClosed`, `SellOrderClosed`
    :   order was fully executed, end of order lifecycle

> BuyOrderClosed / SellOrderClosed   

   ```json
    {
        "@type": "BuyOrderClosed",
        "order_id": 1,

        "client_order_id": 123
    }
    
   ```

    {
        "@type": "OrderNotFound",
        "order_id": 1
    }
    
   ```


## Wallet

-   `SetBalance`
    :   sets a new client balance for a given currency. `reason` can be
        `trade` or `on_hold` for the changes caused by trades,
        `transfer` for balance update by depositing money or `withdraw`
        as a result of a withdrawal.

> SetBalance
